# CV Generation Project

This project contains implementations of DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) and VAE (Variational Autoencoder) for generative modeling, along with quantitative analysis.

## Running the Models

### 1. DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)
To run the standard DDPM implementation, execute the following notebook:
- [DDPM/DDPM_Fashion_Mnist.ipynb](DDPM/DDPM_Fashion_Mnist.ipynb)

### 2. Conditional DDPM
To run the conditional DDPM implementation, execute the following notebook:
- [DDPM/Conditional_DDPM_Fashion_Mnist.ipynb](DDPM/Conditional_DDPM_Fashion_Mnist.ipynb)

### 3. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
To run the VAE implementation, execute the following notebook:
- [VAE/VAE_FM_CNN.ipynb](VAE/VAE_FM_CNN.ipynb)

## Quantitative Analysis
The [Quantitative_Analysis/DDPM_Fashion_Mnist_T_1000.ipynb](Quantitative_Analysis/DDPM_Fashion_Mnist_T_1000.ipynb) notebook contains quantitative analysis and comparison of generated data from both DDPM and VAE models.
